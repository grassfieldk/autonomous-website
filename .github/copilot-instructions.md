# Copilot Coding and Commit Rules

## General Rules

1. **Language Usage**
   - Non-UI elements (e.g., documentation, comments, log outputs, commit messages) should be written in **English** unless otherwise specified.
   - UI elements (e.g., screen display text) must be written in **Japanese**.

2. **Comments**
   - Keep comments minimal and focused on explaining the functionality or logic of the code.
   - Use JSDoc or similar documentation formats actively to describe functions, parameters, and return values.
   - Avoid comments that describe tasks or actions (e.g., "Prepare X for the upper function").

3. **Commit Messages**
   - Write clear and concise commit messages in English.
   - Follow the format: `type(scope): description` (e.g., `feat(auth): add login functionality`).

## UI Text

- All text visible in the UI must be in Japanese.

## Major Changes

- Before making significant changes, summarize the intended modifications and seek approval.
