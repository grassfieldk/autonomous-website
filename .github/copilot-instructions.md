# Copilot Coding and Commit Rules

## General Rules

1. **Language Usage**
   - Non-UI elements (e.g., documentation, comments, log outputs, commit messages) should be written in **English** unless otherwise specified.
   - UI elements (e.g., screen display text) must be written in **Japanese**.
   - When communicating in Japanese, use word spacing for English words within Japanese text for better readability.

2. **Comments**
   - Keep comments minimal and focused on explaining the functionality or logic of the code.
   - Use JSDoc or similar documentation formats actively to describe functions, parameters, and return values.
   - Avoid comments that describe tasks or actions (e.g., "Prepare X for the upper function").

3. **Commit Messages**
   - Write clear and concise commit messages in English.
   - Follow the format: `type(scope): Description` (e.g., `feat(auth): Add login functionality`).
   - Use the imperative mood in the description (e.g., "Fix" instead of "Fixed" or "Fixes").
   - Ensure the description starts with a capital letter.
   - Reference detailed commit guidelines in `docs/commit-guidelines.md`.

4. **Pre-commit Checks**
   - All commits must pass ESLint checks and Prettier formatting.
   - Use the pre-commit hook to ensure compliance before committing.
   - Run security scans and dependency audits automatically.

5. **Development Environment**
   - Use Visual Studio Code with the recommended extensions (`dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`, `esbenp.prettier-vscode`, `github.copilot`).
   - Enable `formatOnSave` in VS Code settings.
   - Follow the setup guide in `docs/development.md`.

6. **Code Quality & Testing**
   - Write tests for all new components and functions following `docs/testing.md`.
   - Ensure all code follows TypeScript best practices with strict type checking.
   - Use component-driven development with proper API design (see `docs/api-reference.md`).
   - Follow performance optimization guidelines in `docs/performance.md`.

7. **Security & Compliance**
   - Implement security best practices as outlined in `docs/security.md`.
   - Validate all inputs and sanitize outputs properly.
   - Follow OWASP Top 10 security guidelines.
   - Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.).

8. **Documentation Standards**
   - Update relevant documentation when making changes.
   - Use clear, concise English in all documentation.
   - Include code examples and usage patterns.
   - Maintain up-to-date API references and component guides.

9. **Major Changes**
   - Before making significant changes, summarize the intended modifications and seek approval.
   - Follow migration procedures outlined in `docs/migration.md` for framework updates.
   - Create proper test coverage for major features.

10. **Autonomous Workflow**
    - All tasks, including coding, documentation, and commits, must be performed by Copilot.
    - Manual edits by the user are not allowed and should be avoided.
    - Use AI-assisted development patterns and best practices.
    - Leverage automated testing and deployment workflows.

## Project Structure Guidelines

- **Components**: Place reusable UI components in `src/components/ui/`
- **Pages**: Use Next.js App Router structure in `src/app/`
- **Documentation**: Maintain docs in `docs/` directory
- **Testing**: Follow testing patterns in `src/__tests__/` and `tests/`
- **Configuration**: Keep all config files in project root with TypeScript when possible

## AI-First Development Principles

1. **Automated Quality Assurance**: Use AI for code review, testing, and optimization
2. **Intelligent Documentation**: Generate and maintain documentation automatically
3. **Proactive Security**: Implement AI-driven security monitoring and compliance
4. **Performance Optimization**: Use AI insights for continuous performance improvement
5. **Maintainable Architecture**: Design for long-term AI-assisted maintenance

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Writing Principles

- **Clarity over Complexity**: Use clear, direct language instead of elaborate expressions
- **Conciseness over Verbosity**: Eliminate redundant phrases and unnecessary words
- **Specificity over Abstraction**: Provide concrete information rather than vague descriptions
- **Active Voice Preference**: Use active voice to make statements more direct and engaging
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology and expressions throughout documentation

### Avoid AI-Generated Hype Expressions

#### 1. Excessive Absoluteness/Completeness Claims

**Avoid:**

- "Revolutionary technology that changes the industry"
- "Ultimate performance solution"
- "Complete problem resolution"
- "World's first/best/most advanced"
- "Game-changing innovation"
- "Guaranteed to solve all issues"

**Use instead:**

- "Effective technology that improves industry practices"
- "High-performance solution"
- "Addresses key problems"
- "New/innovative approach"
- "Significant improvement"
- "Helps resolve many issues"

#### 2. Abstract/Sensational Effect Language

**Avoid:**

- "Works like magic"
- "Miraculous results"
- "Unleash the potential"
- "Supercharge your workflow"
- "Democratize AI"
- "Transform your business overnight"

**Use instead:**

- "Works efficiently"
- "Delivers good results"
- "Maximize potential"
- "Improve your workflow"
- "Make AI more accessible"
- "Improve your business operations"

#### 3. Authority/Predictive Claims

**Avoid:**

- "Will redefine the industry"
- "The future of technology"
- "Inevitable paradigm shift"
- "Next-generation solution"
- "Industry standard of tomorrow"

**Use instead:**

- "May influence industry practices"
- "Modern technology approach"
- "Significant change in approach"
- "Current solution"
- "Emerging industry practice"

### Technical Writing Best Practices

#### 1. Eliminate Redundancy

**Avoid:**

- "First, let's start by..." → "First, let's..." or "Let's start by..."
- "In order to accomplish this task" → "To accomplish this task"
- "It is possible to configure" → "You can configure"
- "Has the ability to process" → "Can process"

#### 2. Use Active Voice

**Prefer:**

- "The system processes data" over "Data is processed by the system"
- "You can configure settings" over "Settings can be configured"
- "This guide explains" over "This guide is designed to explain"

#### 3. Be Specific and Concrete

**Avoid vague terms:**

- "High performance" → "Response time under 100ms"
- "Scalable solution" → "Handles up to 10,000 concurrent users"
- "Easy to use" → "Requires 3 steps to set up"
- "Fast processing" → "Processes 1,000 items per second"

#### 4. Consistent Terminology

- Use the same term for the same concept throughout documentation
- Create and maintain a glossary for project-specific terms
- Avoid synonyms when referring to technical concepts

### List Formatting Guidelines

#### Avoid Mechanical Emphasis Patterns

**Don't use:**

- **Bold:** for every list item start
- Excessive emoji decoration (🚀, ✅, 🔥, 💡, ⭐, 🎯)
- **Important:** or **Note:** labels repeatedly

**Use instead:**

- Clear, descriptive list items without artificial emphasis
- Consistent bullet point structure
- Context-appropriate formatting only when necessary

#### Example - Better List Formatting

**Instead of:**

```
- ✅ **Complete**: Full implementation
- 🚀 **Fast**: High-speed processing
- 💡 **Smart**: AI-powered features
```

**Use:**

```
- Full implementation with proper features
- High-speed processing with optimized algorithms
- AI-powered features for intelligent automation
```

### Documentation Structure Guidelines

#### 1. Organize Information Logically

- Start with overview, then details
- Group related information together
- Use clear headings and subheadings
- Provide navigation aids for long documents

#### 2. Write Scannable Content

- Use bullet points for lists
- Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences max)
- Use code examples to illustrate concepts
- Include practical usage examples

#### 3. Maintain Professional Tone

- Be helpful but not overly enthusiastic
- Focus on facts rather than marketing language
- Acknowledge limitations when they exist
- Provide realistic expectations

### Quality Checklist for Writing

- [ ] Remove redundant phrases and words
- [ ] Convert passive voice to active where appropriate
- [ ] Replace vague terms with specific, measurable descriptions
- [ ] Ensure consistent terminology throughout
- [ ] Eliminate excessive emphasis or promotional language
- [ ] Verify all claims are accurate and realistic
- [ ] Check that examples are practical and tested
