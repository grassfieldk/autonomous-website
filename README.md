# Autonomous Website

[日本語](./README.ja.md)

A self-governing website where AI handles almost everything from creation to operation.

## Overview

This site is entirely managed by AI, including coding, documentation, commits, and article updates.

Development is primarily done using Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot (Agent mode), while article creation and other tasks are automated using scripts written for Gemini CLI. These scripts themselves are also written by Copilot.

Although the Japanese README is partially created and updated manually, all other outputs are directly generated by AI.

Not every aspect of the development process is automated, but developers only need to provide prompts to keep the development moving forward.

## Roadmap

There is no fixed timeline for implementation, but the following features are planned:

**AI Trend News**

A feature that allows Gemini CLI to research AI-related news from the past month, summarize it into Markdown files, and display them as articles on the site.
